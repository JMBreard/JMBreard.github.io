                <h3>Gameplay</h3>
                <p>
                    A two-dimensional top-down view of a character whose objective is to complete unique 
                    levels. To win a level, the player needs to defeat a certain number of enemies or survive 
                    for a set amount of time. Upon completion, one of the room’s four doors opens, leading 
                    the player to the next room. Upon entering the new room, the player is presented with 
                    the characteristics of the next level, allowing them to make an informed betting decision. 
                    A shop opens, allowing the player to wager money, health, and other game aspects, like 
                    boosting enemy damage, to win more money at the end of the level. Each level gets 
                    progressively more difficult, and if the player does not bet, their score will be lower than 
                    it otherwise could be. When a player loses all of their health, they lose the run. A 
                    leaderboard prompts the player to enter a username and displays their score. Win 
                    money to get the highest score! 
                </p>

                <h3>Design Overview</h3>
                <p>
                    The Raging Gambler is built around three main “managers” that act as the game’s 
                    control center: game manager, gamble manager, and reward manager. The game 
                    manager facilitates flow by sequencing each level’s progression. The gamble manager 
                    and reward manager facilitate game balance and enact the gambling mechanic through 
                    altering player and enemy stats. The gamble manager focuses on monetary rewards by 
                    betting on surviving a room’s conditions. The reward manager allows the player to use 
                    money to buy back health, increase speed, or boost the stats needed to compensate for 
                    room conditions. Although surviving longer helps, the path to the leaderboard is winning 
                    the most money.
                </p>

                    This is a general overview of script interactions for player and enemy’s money and 
                    health changes. Player attributes are altered through the PlayerController and 
                    HealthController scripts. Enemy attributes are altered through the EnemyController, 
                    EnemySpawner, and HealthController scripts. HealthController communicates with the 
                    PlayerMoney script and implements the IDamageable interface directing health and 
                    damage control functions. Additionally, HealthController communicates with the Enemy 
                    script for Thief enemies to steal playerMoney and Shooter enemies to perform critical 
                    damage.
